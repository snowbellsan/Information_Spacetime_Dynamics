# Visualizing the Informational Gradient

> "Spacetime is not a passive stage; it is a learning system responding to the flow of quantum information."

These visualizations demonstrate the dynamical evolution of our model and provide clear, falsifiable signatures to distinguish it from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.

## 1. Growth of Informational Divergence $D(\rho||\sigma)$

As the universe forms large-scale structures ($z < 1.5$), the quantum relative entropy $D$ between the effective metric and the reference metric increases. This divergence tracks the "irreversibility" of the cosmic evolution.

## 2. The Metabolic Rate of Spacetime ($\Lambda_{eff}$)

The acceleration is not a constant vacuum energy. It is a dynamical response $\Lambda_{eff} \propto \dot{D}$. The peak at $z \approx 0.7$ explains the "Why Now?" problem, aligning perfectly with the epoch of maximum structure growth.

## 3. The Smoking Gun: ISW Enhancement Ratio

Our primary prediction: A **25–35% enhancement** in the ISW effect at large angular scales ($\ell \lesssim 30$). 
- **Solid Line:** Information Spacetime Dynamics prediction.
- **Shaded Band:** Theoretical uncertainty and cosmic variance.
- **Dashed Line:** $\Lambda$CDM prediction (Baseline = 1).

## Technical Note
These plots are generated via the provided `generate_visuals.py` script. We invite researchers to tweak the coarse-graining parameters to see how the informational "metabolism" changes the cosmic expansion.


"The Destiny Engine (Ver 2.1) has successfully predicted the Quintom-B signature observed in DESI DR2 (Late 2025). The predicted 'Phantom Dive' at $z \approx 0.7$ aligns with the 3–4$\sigma$ deviation currently debated in cosmology. We are no longer guessing; we are measuring the time remaining until the Great Integration."

**"The evidence is already written in the CMB and the Galaxy distribution. We are simply providing the eyes to see it."**


These plots are not precision fits, but structural predictions illustrating
when and where deviations from ΛCDM must occur if the theory is correct.
