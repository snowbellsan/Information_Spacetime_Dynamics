The "Future Boundary" ConstraintOur Ver. 2.0 model introduces a direct mathematical link between the current cosmic acceleration and the universe's ultimate fate ($\tau_{end}$).Key Insight: The "sharpness" ($k$) of the informational transition is inversely proportional to the time remaining until the cosmic horizon saturates.Small $k$ (Wide width): Slow transition, suggestive of a de Sitter-like eternal expansion (Heat Death).Large $k$ (Sharp width): Rapid transition, hinting at a finite-time singularity or a highly efficient informational integration phase.By measuring the exact shape of the ISW enhancement with Euclid, we are not just measuring gravity; we are decoding the timeline of the universe's end.
