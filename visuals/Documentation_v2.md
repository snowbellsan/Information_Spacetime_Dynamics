The Destiny Engine: Decoding the Universal TimelineIn Version 2.1, we formally introduce the "Destiny Parameter" $\tau_{end}$, which links the current rate of cosmic expansion to the total information capacity of the universe's future boundary.Key Phenomenon: The Phantom DiveOur model predicts that the Equation of State $w(z)$ naturally dips below -1 (Phantom region) during the peak of structure formation ($z \approx 0.7-0.8$). This is not a violation of energy conditions, but a back-propagation of information from the future saturation point.$\tau_{end} < 30$ Gyr: Strong Phantom behavior ($w \approx -1.2$), indicating a rapid approach to an informational singularity (Big Rip / Integration Phase).$\tau_{end} > 100$ Gyr: Mild deviation, suggestive of a slow, near-LCDM "Heat Death."Experimental Falsification:If Euclid or DESI data confirms $w < -1$ in the late-time universe, our model provides a direct calculation for the time remaining until the Great Integration.
