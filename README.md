Information Spacetime Dynamics

"Spacetime is learning how it must end."
This repository presents a novel theoretical framework that derives cosmic acceleration from the dynamics of quantum information rather than a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$)1. By treating gravity as an emergent informational response, we provide a falsifiable bridge between quantum information theory and late-time cosmology.

Overview

The $\Lambda$CDM model accurately describes cosmic expansion but leaves the "why now?" of late-time acceleration unexplained3. We propose that acceleration is not driven by a new energy component (Dark Energy), but by spacetime responding to the irreversible flow and compression of quantum information.

Key Concepts

Two Metrics: We introduce an effective metric ($\rho$) encoding quantum informational effects and a reference metric ($\sigma$) determined by classical matter.

Quantum Relative Entropy $D(\rho||\sigma)$: The divergence between these metrics, measured via Rényi-2 entropy, drives the expansion.

Future Boundary Constraints: Space-time geometry evolves along trajectories compatible with its asymptotic informational state at future null infinity ($\mathscr{I}^+$.

Falsifiable Predictions

Unlike traditional models, this framework makes a specific, testable prediction that will be confirmed or ruled out within the next 5 years:
ISW Enhancement: A 25–35% enhancement of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect at large angular scales ($\ell \le 30$).
Observation Targets: This can be decisively tested by upcoming data from Euclid and CMB-S4.

Relation to Holography & Quantum Gravity
This framework is an effective description at the semi-classical level. It identifies Information Geometry as the language nature uses when spacetime responds to information. It completes the intellectual lineage of Jacobson (thermodynamic gravity) and Verlinde (entropic gravity) by making informational divergence explicitly dynamical and time-dependent.


Project Scope

✅ Included: Late-time cosmic acceleration, ISW enhancement, and $H_0$ tension alleviation14.❌ Excluded: UV-complete quantum gravity, Planck-scale physics, or modifications to standard quantum mechanics

Contributing
We invite physicists and information theorists to review the analytical derivations and contribute to the numerical simulations of the informational gradient.


Revised Abstract 

The ΛCDM model accurately describes cosmic expansion, yet the late-time onset of acceleration remains conceptually unexplained.

We propose that cosmic acceleration does not originate from new energy components, but from spacetime responding to the irreversible flow of quantum information. 
We introduce two semi-classical metrics: an effective metric ρ encoding quantum informational effects, and a reference metric σ determined solely by classical matter. 
Their divergence is quantified using quantum relative entropy D(ρ‖σ), constructed from Rényi-2 entropy of coarse-grained degrees of freedom. The late-time growth of D(ρ‖σ), driven by structure formation, induces dynamical acceleration and predicts a 25–35% enhancement of the Integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect at large angular scales. This prediction is testable within five years by Euclid and CMB-S4. The framework is falsifiable: observations will either confirm the predicted ISW enhancement or rule out information geometry as a physical origin of late-time cosmic acceleration.
