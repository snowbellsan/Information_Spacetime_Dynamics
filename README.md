Revised Abstract 

The ΛCDM model accurately describes cosmic expansion, yet the late-time onset of acceleration remains conceptually unexplained. 
We propose that cosmic acceleration does not originate from new energy components, but from spacetime responding to the irreversible flow of quantum information. 
We introduce two semi-classical metrics: an effective metric ρ encoding quantum informational effects, and a reference metric σ determined solely by classical matter. 
Their divergence is quantified using quantum relative entropy D(ρ‖σ), constructed from Rényi-2 entropy of coarse-grained degrees of freedom. The late-time growth of D(ρ‖σ), driven by structure formation, induces dynamical acceleration and predicts a 25–35% enhancement of the Integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect at large angular scales. This prediction is testable within five years by Euclid and CMB-S4. The framework is falsifiable: observations will either confirm the predicted ISW enhancement or rule out information geometry as a physical origin of late-time cosmic acceleration.
