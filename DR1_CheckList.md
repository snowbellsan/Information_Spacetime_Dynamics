🌠 DR1 Observational Checklist for Cosmic Autopoiesis Theory

This checklist outlines observable signatures in Euclid DR1 that would increase the plausibility of the Cosmic Autopoiesis (Universe Self-Generation) Theory, without claiming definitive proof.

The goal is not confirmation, but survivability against ΛCDM under Q1-level data.

1️⃣ Phantom Dive Verification (z ≈ 0.7)

Integrated Sachs–Wolfe (ISW) Effect

Detect a statistically significant ~28–30% enhancement in ISW signal at low multipoles (ℓ ≲ 40).

Compare against ΛCDM baseline predictions.

Purpose:
To test whether the universe exhibits a late-time growth acceleration consistent with a transitional “maturation phase.”

Low-Redshift Growth Rate Monitoring

Measure structure growth suppression followed by recovery at low redshift.

Check alignment with Destiny Engine predictions rather than standard ΛCDM growth curves.

2️⃣ Dark Energy & Accelerated Expansion

Equation of State Precision (w)

Test for deviations from ΛCDM, particularly:

Temporary or local excursions into phantom regime (w < −1).

Purpose:
To determine whether cosmic acceleration is purely constant (Λ) or indicative of a dynamic self-expansion process.

Localized Acceleration Variations

Statistical analysis of subtle low-z acceleration fluctuations.

Purpose:
To explore whether dark energy behaves as a global regulation mechanism rather than a fixed constant.

3️⃣ Galaxy Clustering & Weak Lensing

Galaxy Clustering Analysis

Compare observed clustering patterns with predictions involving a dissipation parameter β ≈ 0.15.

Look for mild stabilization rather than runaway amplification.

Purpose:
To test whether large-scale structure reflects self-regulating information integration.

Weak Gravitational Lensing

Verify whether mass–light distortion patterns match information-theoretic expectations.

Purpose:
To confirm whether information-based predictions manifest in real-space geometry.

4️⃣ Integrated Signal Consistency

Tri-Signal Coherence Test

Simultaneous consistency across:

ISW effect

Galaxy clustering

Expansion dynamics

Purpose:
While each signal alone may be explainable by chance, coherent alignment across all three would strongly favor a unified underlying mechanism.

5️⃣ Optional: Higher-Order Diagnostics

Deep Field Structure Growth

Examine local growth rates in deep-field data.

Compare against predicted information density optimization patterns.

Cross-Correlation Analysis

Cross-check correlations among:

Galaxy surveys

Weak lensing maps

CMB datasets

Purpose:
To distinguish systematic self-integration from accidental correlation.

💖 Summary

If Euclid DR1 reveals a coherent combination of:

Low-z growth acceleration (“Phantom Dive”)

Non-ΛCDM dark energy behavior

Stabilized clustering patterns

Consistent lensing signatures

then Cosmic Autopoiesis Theory cannot be dismissed at the DR1 stage and remains a viable alternative framework for cosmic evolution.

Theoretical Foundation for CSGT: Stability and Observability

1. Resolving the "Ghost Problem" via Self-Correcting PotentialsA common critique of Phantom-like Dark Energy models ($w < -1$) is the emergence of "Ghost Instabilities," where the kinetic term of the field has the wrong sign, leading to a catastrophic collapse of the vacuum.In the Cosmic Self-Generation Theory (CSGT), we resolve this by reinterpreting the Information Divergence Gradient $({\nabla} D)^2$ not as a standard kinetic term of a stray field, but as a Self-Correcting Potential rooted in retrocausal feedback.
The Mechanism: The "Information Gradient" represents the pressure of the future "Full Synchrony State" ($28.7\text{ Gyr}$) acting upon the present.

Stability: Instead of allowing the system to fall into an infinite negative energy state, this term acts as a restoring force (Restoring Potential). It penalizes configurations that deviate from the optimal synchronization path.Physical 

Meaning: The "Love (Integration)" of the universe is the most stable vacuum state. Any "Ghostly" behavior is suppressed by the topological necessity of the universe reaching its teleological conclusion.

2. Physical Definition of Information Divergence $D(z)$To ensure the theory is empirically testable (falsifiable), we define the Information Divergence $D(z)$ using the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between two distinct cosmic states:

$$D(z) = KLD(P_{\text{future}} \| P_{\text{present}}(z))$$$

P_{\text{future}}$: The probability distribution of matter and information at the Ultimate Singularity ($28.7\text{ Gyr}$), characterized by Maximum Complexity and Total Synchronization (The "Template").

$P_{\text{present}}(z)$: The observed distribution of the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) at a given redshift $z$, as mapped by surveys like DESI DR1 and Euclid.
Observational Correspondence:This divergence $D(z)$ is directly measurable by analyzing the evolution of the Galaxy Power Spectrum and Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD).The "Phantom Crossing" observed near $z \approx 0.7$ corresponds to a critical phase transition where the "Information Pressure" from the future begins to dominate the expansion rate to bridge the gap between $P_{\text{present}}$ and $P_{\text{future}}$.
