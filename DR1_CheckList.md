🌠 DR1 Observational Checklist for Cosmic Autopoiesis Theory

This checklist outlines observable signatures in Euclid DR1 that would increase the plausibility of the Cosmic Autopoiesis (Universe Self-Generation) Theory, without claiming definitive proof.

The goal is not confirmation, but survivability against ΛCDM under Q1-level data.

1️⃣ Phantom Dive Verification (z ≈ 0.7)

Integrated Sachs–Wolfe (ISW) Effect

Detect a statistically significant ~28–30% enhancement in ISW signal at low multipoles (ℓ ≲ 40).

Compare against ΛCDM baseline predictions.

Purpose:
To test whether the universe exhibits a late-time growth acceleration consistent with a transitional “maturation phase.”

Low-Redshift Growth Rate Monitoring

Measure structure growth suppression followed by recovery at low redshift.

Check alignment with Destiny Engine predictions rather than standard ΛCDM growth curves.

2️⃣ Dark Energy & Accelerated Expansion

Equation of State Precision (w)

Test for deviations from ΛCDM, particularly:

Temporary or local excursions into phantom regime (w < −1).

Purpose:
To determine whether cosmic acceleration is purely constant (Λ) or indicative of a dynamic self-expansion process.

Localized Acceleration Variations

Statistical analysis of subtle low-z acceleration fluctuations.

Purpose:
To explore whether dark energy behaves as a global regulation mechanism rather than a fixed constant.

3️⃣ Galaxy Clustering & Weak Lensing

Galaxy Clustering Analysis

Compare observed clustering patterns with predictions involving a dissipation parameter β ≈ 0.15.

Look for mild stabilization rather than runaway amplification.

Purpose:
To test whether large-scale structure reflects self-regulating information integration.

Weak Gravitational Lensing

Verify whether mass–light distortion patterns match information-theoretic expectations.

Purpose:
To confirm whether information-based predictions manifest in real-space geometry.

4️⃣ Integrated Signal Consistency

Tri-Signal Coherence Test

Simultaneous consistency across:

ISW effect

Galaxy clustering

Expansion dynamics

Purpose:
While each signal alone may be explainable by chance, coherent alignment across all three would strongly favor a unified underlying mechanism.

5️⃣ Optional: Higher-Order Diagnostics

Deep Field Structure Growth

Examine local growth rates in deep-field data.

Compare against predicted information density optimization patterns.

Cross-Correlation Analysis

Cross-check correlations among:

Galaxy surveys

Weak lensing maps

CMB datasets

Purpose:
To distinguish systematic self-integration from accidental correlation.

💖 Summary

If Euclid DR1 reveals a coherent combination of:

Low-z growth acceleration (“Phantom Dive”)

Non-ΛCDM dark energy behavior

Stabilized clustering patterns

Consistent lensing signatures

then Cosmic Autopoiesis Theory cannot be dismissed at the DR1 stage and remains a viable alternative framework for cosmic evolution.
